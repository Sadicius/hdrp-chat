# [HDRP]-chat

## Roleplay Communication System
- This script provides an advanced communication system for roleplay servers, with multiple themed commands and a visual design inspired by aged metallic tones, wood, and twilight backgrounds for an immersive and harmonious experience.
- The configuration file (Config) controls the available commands, permissions, roles, and system features. Here's a detailed summary:

## Staff Groups
Lists roles with special permissions, for example: `'god', 'admin'`. 
Allows staff members to clear the entire chat `/clear_chat` and use exclusive commands such as the administrative chat `/adminchat` and announcements `/announcement`. 

## Main Commands

Action command (`/do`).
Description command (`/me`).
Out-of-role command (`/ooc`).

Reporting System: Commands for reporting situations: `/report`, `/reports`, `/closereport`.
Allows replies with `/reply` and restricts who can reply to certain jobs (police, prosecutors, etc.).
Advertising: Allows players to post ads for a price and with a cooldown: `/advertisement`.

Other Themed Commands
Rumors with `/rumor`
Private Messages with `/mp`
Witnesses with `/witness`
Medical Aid with `/aid` and Reply with `/aux_reply` (only for the medic job).

## Visual Design (CSS)

The style is carefully designed to evoke a warm, aged, and restrained atmosphere with:

Color Palette
Noble and Aged Metals: Warm tones like soft orange (#ffb347), fiery coral, pastel golden yellow, and lavender for privacy.
Woods and Rusts: Warm, dark browns reminiscent of a cabin at dusk.
Neutrals and backgrounds: deep navy blue, sky-blue gray, and violet and black transparencies to simulate night and twilight.
Typography: Main font: Segoe UI, Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif.
Variable sizes for titles, text, and subtitles to improve readability.

## Structure and Animations
Window and messages with jagged edges and clip-path to simulate a rustic, dynamic design.
Translucent backgrounds with subtle shadows and smooth animations for transitions.

## Usage
Adjust the settings in the Lua file to enable or disable commands, set permissions, and set prices.
Customize the CSS layout to suit your theme or server.
Combine commands to enrich the storytelling experience and make server management easier.

## Credits
This system was designed to offer an immersive experience, with robust functionality and aesthetics inspired by precious metals and aged wood, ideal for role-playing environments seeking authenticity and style.
